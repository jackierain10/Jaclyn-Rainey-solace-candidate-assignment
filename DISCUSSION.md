//TO DO

// in-line style for now, I would utilize the globals.css more for a real application and add class names to elements

// utilize the advocates schema in page.tsx so that advocates isn't of type never.

// it would be nice to be able to have a UI setting for what you want to search on (name, location, specialty, etc.)
// however, will I have time to implement that now?...

// add table sorting by clicking on header to sort a given column by ascending or descending

// not a fan of being able to search on first or last name, but not the combo. I would change this

// I would make a lot more UI updates, but I did my best with the time I had!
